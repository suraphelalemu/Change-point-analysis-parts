Methodology

Bayesian Change Point Detection Our approach uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to identify:

Number of structural breaks

Breakpoint locations

Posterior distributions of regime parameters
Statistical Models

Gaussian Process Model: For smooth transitions between regimes

Hierarchical Model: Captures uncertainty across multiple change points

Volatility Clustering: GARCH components for heteroskedasticity
Validation

Posterior predictive checks

Convergence diagnostics (R-hat, effective sample size)

Cross-validation on holdout periods
Results

Key Findings Major Change Points detected during:

2008 Financial Crisis

2014 OPEC Price War

2020 COVID-19 Pandemic
Volatility Regimes:

High volatility during geopolitical crises

Lower volatility during stable market periods
Event Impact:

OPEC decisions show strongest correlation with breaks

Geopolitical events cause short-term spikes
